					We built Absent to be the absence sidekick you keep coming back to. A living timeline tracks every submitted form, reminders nudge you before deadlines, and personal notes make sure nothing is forgotten.
				</p>
				<ul class="retention-points">
					<li>Keep a searchable archive of every absence request.</li>
					<li>Automatic drafts when your calendar shows a conflict again.</li>
					<li>Share updates with parents or guardians in one click.</li>

				<h3>Why another app?</h3>
				<p>
					Because variety matters. Our friends at
					<a class="link" href="https://absendo.app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">absendo.app</a>
					already offer a solid solution. Absent is our playful experiment to explore different ideas, smoother onboarding, and retention-focused features.
				</p>
				<p>
					Competition keeps us all sharp, and you benefit from better tools no matter which one you choose.

			<h3>Friendly heads-up</h3>
			<p>
				Absent is a fun side project created by students for students. There is no commercial backing, just curiosity and late-night coding sessions. Expect transparency, rapid iteration, and the occasional rough edge.
