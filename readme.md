# Absent

**Absence forms generated in seconds. From students, for students.**

### 📖 What is Absent?

**Absent** is a free web tool designed to make the life of vocational students (Lernende) in Switzerland easier. We all know the hassle: you miss a day of school due to illness or an appointment, and you have to manually fill out a PDF form, look up which lessons you missed, find the exact names of your teachers, and format everything correctly.

**Absent automates this entire process.**

By connecting to your **Schulnetz** calendar, Absent automatically detects which lessons you missed on a specific date and fills out the official school form (Entschuldigung / Urlaubsgesuch) for you. What used to take 10 minutes of typing and searching now takes less than 60 seconds.

### ✨ Key Features

* **⚡ Automatic Form Filling:** Enter your personal details (Name, Class, Vocational Trainer) once, and they are saved for next time.
* **📅 Calendar Sync:** Connect your personal Schulnetz calendar link. Absent reads your schedule and automatically lists the exact lessons, subjects, and teachers you missed.
* **📝 Official Templates:** Generates PDFs that match the official layouts required by schools like **BBZW** and **BBZG**.
* **🛡️ Privacy Focused:** Your data belongs to you. We do not sell data, show ads, or track you.
* **📂 Two Modes:** Supports both *Entschuldigung* (Excuse for illness) and *Urlaubsgesuch* (Leave request).

### 🏫 Supported Schools

Currently, Absent is optimized for the following vocational schools in the Canton of Lucerne:

* **BBZW** (Berufsbildungszentrum Wirtschaft, Informatik und Technik)
* **BBZG** (Berufsbildungszentrum Gesundheit und Soziales)

*More schools may be added in the future.*

### 🚀 How to Use It

1.  **Register:** Create a free account to save your basic details (Name, Class, Company).
2.  **Connect:** Follow the simple guide to find your "Schulnetz Calendar URL" and paste it into your profile.
3.  **Select Date:** Choose the day you were absent.
4.  **Download:** Click "Generate PDF." Absent looks up your schedule for that day and gives you a ready-to-print PDF.

### ℹ️ About the Project

**Absent** was born out of frustration with repetitive paperwork. It is a hobby project developed with the belief that technology should eliminate boring tasks, allowing students to focus on learning.

* **Status:** The project is currently in **Beta**.
* **Philosophy:** "Everything you need, nothing you don't."
* **Open Source:** The code for this project is visible to the public to ensure transparency and trust.

### 👤 About the Maintainer

This project is developed and maintained by **Baitimus**.

As a student myself, I realized how much time was wasted manually looking up teacher names and lesson times for every single absence. I built Absent to solve this problem for myself and my classmates.
